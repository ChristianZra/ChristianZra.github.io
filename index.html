<h2 id="history"><u>The History of Arkham Academy</u></h2>
<p id="history2">Arkham Academy is the official school of Gotham. This school is built in the spot of the very old Arkham Asylum. After Batman got rid of all the people occupying the Arkham Asylum, and moved them to a different place, the Arkham Asylum was completely empty, so Mr. Bruce Wayne, the founder and creator of this school decided to turn it into a school, rather an academy. Now most of the children of Gotham attend Arkham Academy, A.K.A. Abandoned Arkham Asylum. Here, in this academy we want to change the city of Gotham, and we want to make it a better place, starting with our future. If you want your child's future to be bright, let them learn in the darkness, Arkham Academy.</p>
